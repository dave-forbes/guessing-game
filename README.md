# guessing-game

I came accross this tutorial (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash) and decided to try and recreate the app without following the walk through. My solution is a bit different from theirs but it seems to work ok to me. I may come back to this another time.
